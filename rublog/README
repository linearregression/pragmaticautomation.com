NOTE: Early September, 2004, the format of rublog.cgi changed. See the
end of this README for details.

See doc/*. In particular:

Welcome.rdoc::
   general description and some pointers

SimpleInstallation.rdoc::
   how to get up and running with the minimum of fuss

FullInstallation.rdoc::
   all the gory details

RublogBasics.rdoc::
   how to use the blog

InputFormats/*::
   the various formats for raw articles

I strongly recommending installing RubLog using the SimpleInstallation
instructions, and then reading the rest of this material using RubLog
itself.

NOTE:

In early September 2004, the way RubLog objects are created was
changed. This makes WEBRick and FastCGI implementations more
efficient, but unfortunately is incompatible with existing rublog.cgi
scripts. However, the change is fairly mechanical.

1. The output style parameter (standard, movable, etc) is now simply
   another RubLog option, and not a parameter to CGIRequest.new.

     blog.style = "standard"

2. The RubLog constructor takes a single parameter, the name of the
   blog data directory.

3. The line View.new(...) is now replaced with

      blog.process_request(CGIRequest.new, CGIResponse.new)

See the sample rublog.cgi file for the full, gory, details.
