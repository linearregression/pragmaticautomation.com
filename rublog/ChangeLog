2005-01-22  Dave Thomas  <dave@pragprog.com>

	* Request.rb (WebRequest::determine_date_range): The issue with
	  detecting dates in URLs is getting trickier. The fix
	  made on 11-10 was incorrect, as it broke the
	  calendar. Try something different.

2004-11-10  Dave Thomas  <dave@pragprog.com>

	* Request.rb (WebRequest::determine_date_range): If a pathname
	  contained somehing that looked like a reasonable date,
	  rublog extracted it as the constraining date for the
	  request.

2004-09-13  Dave Thomas  <dave@pragprog.com>

	* FileEntries.rb (FileEntries::traverse): Symbolic links to
	  missing files no longer cause a crash.

	  entries patch (rubyforge#653).

	* ThisRubLogRequest.rb: Totally change the way RubLog objects are created,
	  configured, and how requests are processed. This is a step towards
	  better FastCGI and WEBrick versions, as you now create one RubLog object
	  that can handle multiple requests.

	  NOTE: This change breaks existing rublog.cgi scripts (but the change is
	  minimal). See README for details.

2004-08-24  Dave Thomas  <dave@fast.local.thomases.com>

2004-03-08  Dave Thomas  <dave@pragprog.com>

2004-01-07  Dave Thomas  <dave@pragprog.com>

		  certain point in the filesystem

		  database.

2003-11-24  Dave Thomas  <dave@wireless_2.local.thomases.com>

2003-04-22  Martin Fowler <fowler@acm.org>

	look for 'SourceCodeControl', and [[fred]] will look for 'fred'.

2003-04-10  Martin Fowler: <fowler@acm.org>

		  reorganize how page templates work. Existing users:
	          1. Remove the 'require "rublog_page_template" from rublog.cgi
		  2. If you have a customized rublog_page_template, it now lives
		     in styles/standard.rb
	          3. You can add multiple styles by creating xxx.rb in the
	             styles/ directory and adding /style/xxx to
	             the URL you use to invoke rublog.
	
	* RDocMarkup.rb: Report the obvious error if it can find the RDoc
		  simple_markup component.
