<h1>HTML Format</h1>

A file ending in .htm and .html is passed straight through. If it
contains <em>&lt;title>stuff&lt;/title></em>
or <em>&lt;h1>stuff&lt;/h1></em>, then that text is used at the title,
otherwise the first line of the file is used.

<p />

It possible to include complete HTML files as RubLog
articles. However, RubLog does no particular parsing of HTML files,
so the resulting log, while displaying propertly in all browsers I've
tried, won't validate as HTML.

<p />

Text in the file between &lt;summary&gt; and &lt;/summary&gt; is an
article summary: it remains in the article, and will be used as the
article's synopsis if synopsis mode is enabled..
