Chad Fowler added support for Webrick (which meant tidying up my ugly
response handling). The script shown here illustrates one possible way
to include the Rublog servlet in a Webrick server. To run it, use

   ruby -I../.. rublog_servlet.rb  [ -p port ]

This code is currently in an alpha state. We're interested in bugs,
but like the rest of RubLog it's unsupported.
