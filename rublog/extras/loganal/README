This is a simple script to extract RubLog usage stats from an Apache
access_log. It generates a simple HTML file that can be included in
the sidebar using the MiniBlog facility.

To use, 

1. if you don't already have a MiniBlog directory, create one
   somewhere. It has to be writable by you and readable by your web
   server.

2. set up a cron job to invoke loganal periodically. 

    10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/ruby \
       /usr/rublog/extras/loganal/loganal.rb <access_log> <pattern> \
        >/var/www/pragprog/data/pragdave_traffic.html


   Replace <i>access_log</i> with the path to your Apache access_log
   file. Replace <i>pattern</i> with a regular expression that can
   be used to differentiate access to your blog from other lines 
   in the log. For example, my blog is mounted at "/pragdave", so
   all accesses have "GET /pragdave..." or "HEAD /pragdave..." in
   them. I use "\s/pragdave/ as my pattern.

3. set up MiniBlog to point to this directory (if it isn't already)

    require "sidebar/MiniBlog"
    MiniBlogs.create_for("/var/www/pragprog/data")

4. Enjoy watching millions of folks sucking up your bandwidth.
