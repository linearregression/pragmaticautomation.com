= Quick 'n Dirty RSS

abstract::
Need to monitor a web site that doesn't have an RSS feed.  Here's how.

Email is still the first thing I check in the morning, but my RSS
aggregator isn't far behind.  It monitors everything I'm really
interested in.  And if a site doesn't have an RSS feed, I'll forget to
check it.  

Trouble is, not all sites have an RSS feed (yet).  Beg if you must,
then {do it
yourself}[http://www.vandervossen.net/2003/07/quick_n_dirty_rss_with_xslt].
