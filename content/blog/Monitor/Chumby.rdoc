{Chumby}[http://www.chumby.com/corporate/whatischumby] looks to be a fun way to monitor automation in and around projects.  It's a portable Internet-connected device that displays visual widgets.  Just "trust the Chumby" and it autodiscovers your wifi network.  

But what makes Chumby special is the {open and hackable design}[http://www.christine.net/2006/08/announcing_the_.html].  Want a custom widget?  Make one.  Got some hardware you'd like to integrate?  Plug it into the chumbilical.  

This is going to be fun to watch. Please send pictures of Chumby at work on your software project!
