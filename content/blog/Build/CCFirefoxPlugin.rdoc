== Firefox Plugin for CruiseControl

abstract:: 
Monitor CruiseControl builds from Firefox.

Inspired by the recent {Dashboard
widget}[http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Build/CCWidget.rdoc],
Dmitri Maximovich wrote a {Firefox
plugin}[http://www.md.pp.ru/mozilla/cc/] to monitor builds in
CruiseControl.  He's looking for your feedback to help make it
even better...
