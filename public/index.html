<p>
Your software is being automatically built and tested on a schedule. It
even sends you an email when the code doesn&#8217;t compile or pass its
tests. You&#8217;re certainly ahead of most projects, but email is just so
90s. Even if you could manage to find those build failure emails amidst all
that spam, you&#8217;re reading yesterday&#8217;s news. Indeed, you may
already be ignoring the status of the scheduled build.
</p>

<p>
The Monitoring chapter of <a
href="http://pragprog.com/book/auto/pragmatic-project-automation">the book</a> offers
alternative, in-your-face, worth-getting-up-for-in-the-morning techniques
for monitoring scheduled builds. The most popular technique came by way of
a story contributed by <a
href="http://www.developertesting.com/managed_developer_testing/000036.html">Alberto
Savoia</a>. He describes how his project uses red and green lava lamps to
radiate the status of their scheduled build. Better yet, those lamps are
controlled using X10 devices such as those used to turn on your household
lamps so that you don&#8217;t arrive home to a dark house.
</p>
<p>
Well, as you might imagine, I could hardly wait to build my very own
build-monitoring lava lamp kit. And as bonus material for readers of the
book, I&#8217;ve crafted a bit o&#8217; software that integrates with <a
href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a>. So now you
too can enjoy red and green bubbles on your project!
</p>
<h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
<p>
To get started, you need some automation gear. Think of these gadgets as
this year&#8217;s essential project accessories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.x10.com/products/firecracker.htm">4-Piece Firecracker
Automation System</a>

<p>
This kit includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Firecracker Computer Interface

</li>
<li>1 Transceiver Module

</li>
<li>1 Lamp Module

</li>
<li>1 Palm Pad Remote Control

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Cost: $39.99
</p>
<p>
(Props go to the folks at <a href="http://x10.com">x10.com</a> for
supporting this project by supplying me with a complimentary kit. It all
fits in a wee box, so I can carry it from project to project.)
</p>
<p>
With that kit, you can control two lava lamps &#8212; one plugged into the
transceiver module and the other plugged into the lamp module. You can
optionally purchase another appliance module if you want to control two
appliances. For example, you might want your build process to turn on a
coffee pot when the build fails and then kick start your margarita machine
when the build is fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>2 lamps, preferably the kind that boil red and green lava

<p>
I used the <a href="http://www.mmeworld.com/">Hot Rock Lite F/X</a> (yellow
earth/blue liquid and red earth/purple liquid). Note for legal purposes
that these lamps (shown in pictures below) are <em>not</em> <a
href="http://lavaworld.com/">LAVA(R) brand motion lamps</a>, but those will
work just as well.
</p>
<p>
Cost: $9.99 each at Target or Walmart
</p>
</li>
<li><a
href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/code/pragautox10-1_0.zip">Pragmatic
Automation X10 software</a>

<p>
It&#8217;s an open source Java library that includes the CruiseControl
plug-in, an API to make your wildest X10 dreams come true, detailed
instructions, and an ever-so-useful collection of tests.
</p>
<p>
Way down deep, the library uses the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/">Java Communications API</a>
to send bits out over the serial port and into the Firecracker Computer
Interface. (Linux users will need the <a
href="http://www.rxtx.org/">RXTX</a> implementation). Michel Dalal&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.micheldalal.com/sw/java/x10/">Java X10 CM17A API
library</a>, an implementation of the <a
href="ftp://ftp.x10.com/pub/manuals/cm17a_protocol.txt">FireCracker (CM17A)
Communications Specification</a>, is used to send out the correct 1s and 0s
in response to human-friendly commands. Many thanks to him for doing all
the low-level bit twiddling and sharing the goodies with us!
</p>
<p>
Cost: Free to readers of <a

Automation</a>
</p>

</ul>
<h3>Assembling the Kit</h3>
<p>
With that hardware in hand, you&#8217;re ready to start the assembly
process. The Firecracker Automation System includes instructions written
for your average home electronics consumer, so your average
computer/network geek should have no trouble. I&#8217;ll spare you all the
gory details and instead run through a quick visual tutorial of my setup.
</p>
<p>
Start by plugging the Firecracker Computer Interface into a serial port of
your scheduled build machine:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/images/firecracker.jpg">
</p>
<p>
This little gem sends a wireless signal from the computer to the
transceiver module. Notice that you don&#8217;t lose the serial port. You
can plug another serial device into the back of Firecracker Computer
Interface.
</p>
<p>
Next, plug the transceiver module into any wall outlet within your
electrical wiring system. Then turn on the lamp you want the build process
to light up when the build fails (the red lamp) and plug it into the
transceiver module:
</p>
<p>
<img
src="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/images/transceiver_module.jpg">
</p>
<p>
See that antennae on the transceiver? The transceiver picks up the RF
signal sent by the Firecracker Computer Interface connected to the
computer, converts it into an X10 signal, and broadcasts the X10 signal
across the electrical wiring system.
</p>
<p>
Every X10 module is uniquely identified by a house code (A-P) and a unit
code (1-16). By default, the transceiver is configured to listen on
&quot;A1&quot;. So when the Firecracker Computer Interface sends a signal
that tells module &quot;A1&quot; to turn on, the device that&#8217;s
connected to the transceiver&#8212;the red lamp&#8212;is turned on.
</p>
<p>
Next, plug the lamp module into a wall outlet and set its house and unit
code to &quot;A2&quot;. Then turn on the lamp you want the build process to
light up when the build <em>passes</em> (the green lamp) and plug it into
the lamp module, like so:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/images/lamp_module.jpg">
</p>
<p>
When the Firecracker Computer Interface sends a signal instructing the
&quot;A2&quot; module to turn on, the transceiver picks up the signal and
broadcasts it out over the electrical wires. The lamp module hears the
signal and turns on the green lamp.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s it for assembly!
</p>
<p>
At this point it&#8217;s a good idea to make sure you can turn these lamps
on and off at will using the free software <a
href="http://www.x10.com/products/firecracker.htm">(separate download</a>)
that emulates the Palm Pad Remote Control. It sends signals through the
Firecracker Computer Interface, so it&#8217;s a good sanity check that you
have everything hooked up correctly.
</p>
<h3>Installing the Software</h3>
<p>
OK, now you want to hook the lava lamps up to your scheduled build process
running in <a
href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a>.
That&#8217;s where the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/code/pragautox10-1_0.zip">Pragmatic
Automation X10 software</a> comes in.
</p>
<p>
The README file describes how to install and test the software in detail.
The final step is to register the CruiseControl plug-in that effectively
wires up the lamps to indicate the status of each CruiseControl build
cycle. Just to demonstrate how easy that is, here&#8217;s the XML you need
to add to CruiseControl&#8217;s <tt>config.xml</tt> file:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;plugin name=&quot;x10publisher&quot; classname=&quot;com.pragauto.X10Publisher&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;publishers&gt;
    &lt;x10publisher port=&quot;COM1&quot; passDeviceCode=&quot;A2&quot; failDeviceCode=&quot;A1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/publishers&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Edit the attributes of the <tt>&lt;x10publisher&gt;</tt> element as
necessary for your serial port and device codes. A complete
<tt>config.xml</tt> file is included in the project as a reference.
</p>
<h3>Bubbles While You Work</h3>
<p>
Once you&#8217;ve fired up CruiseControl and a build succeeds, you&#8217;ll
see something like this on the console:
</p>
<pre>
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  Total time: 10 seconds
  [cc]Jul-08 16:56:53 Project       - Project dms:  merging accumulated log files
  [cc]Jul-08 16:56:53 Project       - Project dms:  publishing build results
  [cc]Jul-08 16:56:53 X10Publisher  - Turning pass device (A2) on; fail device (A1) off ...
  [cc]Jul-08 16:56:56 Project       - Project dms:  idle
  [cc]Jul-08 16:56:56 Project       - Project dms:  next build in 1 minutes
</pre>
<p>
At that point, the green lava lamp should turn on. Bask in that pleasant
glow for a moment. When the lamp gets warmed up, you&#8217;ll get
entertained by happy, green bubbles:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/images/green_bubbles.jpg">
</p>
<p>
And then at some point somebody might check in code that causes the build
to fail. (Hey, it happens to even the best programmers once in a while.)
Here&#8217;s the early warning sign that the scheduled build is in trouble:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/images/trouble.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Eek! Notice that the ambient light in the red lamp goes on immediately. It
will take a while for the red lava to heat up and start to boil. In the
meantime, there&#8217;s work to be done. When you check the CruiseControl
log, you&#8217;ll see something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  BUILD FAILED
  file:C:/work/dms/builds/checkout/dms/build.xml:77: Tests failed! Check test reports.

  Total time: 5 seconds
  [cc]Jul-08 16:58:20 Project       - Project dms:  merging accumulated log files
  [cc]Jul-08 16:58:20 Project       - Project dms:  publishing build results
  [cc]Jul-08 16:58:20 X10Publisher  - Turning pass device (A2) off; fail device (A1) on...
  [cc]Jul-08 16:58:23 Project       - Project dms:  idle
  [cc]Jul-08 16:58:23 Project       - Project dms:  next build in 1 minutes
</pre>
<p>
If it takes too long to fix the build, the red lamp will start to get
angry:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/images/red_bubbles.jpg">
</p>
<p>
The object of the game is to keep the green lamp glowing. :-)
</p>
<h3>Hearing the Build Break</h3>
<p>
You may have noticed that when the transceiver module turns on and off it
makes a fairly loud snapping sound. That sound is caused by the mechanical
relay inside. (The lamp module doesn&#8217;t make that sound, I suspect
because it&#8217;s a low-current device that doesn&#8217;t use a mechanical
relay.)
</p>
<p>
This audible feedback turns out to be quite handy if your team is working
in close quarters. The &quot;snap&quot; could be yet another sound in your
<a
href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Monitor/ListeningToComplexSystems.rdoc">project
soundscape</a>. By plugging the red lamp into the transceiver module (A1),
you&#8217;ll hear that snapping sound just before the red lamp turns on. So
if you&#8217;re heads down (without headphones), the sound will alert you
to a build failure. Indeed, you&#8217;ll hear the build break!
</p>
<h3>Important Safety Notes</h3>
<p>
These lamps get insanely hot. If you don&#8217;t let them cool down for at
least five minutes before touching the glass, you&#8217;ll find out just
<em>how</em> hot. (Yes, even the green one is hot.)
</p>
<p>
The instructions for my lamps note that they perform best if operated for
less than ten hours at a time. Your local fire marshal would certainly
agree. But who will remember to turn off the lamps at the end of every
programming day? Well, that&#8217;s a job for the ol&#8217; computer. Just
write a shutdown program that uses the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/code/pragautox10-1_0.zip">Pragmatic
Automation X10 software</a> to turn off the lamps. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  new X10Device(&quot;COM1&quot;, &quot;A1&quot;).off();
  new X10Device(&quot;COM1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;).off();
</pre>
<p>
Then schedule an <tt>at</tt> or <tt>cron</tt> job on the scheduled build
machine that runs the shutdown program at some hour of every evening, and
another program that turns the lamps on every morning.
</p>
<h3>What About My Macintosh?</h3>
<p>
The Firecracker Computer Interface plugs into a serial port. Modern day
Macintosh computers don&#8217;t have a serial port. Sadly, none of the
USB-to-serial converters I tried worked with the Firecracker Computer
Interface. (I&#8217;d love to hear otherwise.)
</p>
<p>
You can purchase X10 kits that plug into USB, but I chose to use the
Firecracker kit because it&#8217;s relatively cheap and it&#8217;s what is
described in the book. Thankfully, by writing and testing most of this
software against a mock device, I was able to do the majority of the
development on my PowerBook. :-)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> wrote in to say that he
  has it on good authority that the <a
  href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/usa19hs/homepage.spml">KeySpan
  USA-19HS</a> will properly drive a <a
  href="http://www.x10.com/products/firecracker.htm">Firecracker</a>. The
  Keyspan adapter comes with Mac OS X drivers that speak the handshake
  signals the Firecracker listens for. Huzzah! That means you can remotely
  control your lava
  lamps from your Mac.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
It&#8217;s relatively easy and inexpensive to make build monitoring a
spectator sport. Put the lava lamps in a highly-visible area of your
project and use them as visual (and audible) feedback devices, and to show
off your programming prowess, of course. And that&#8217;s just the
beginning. You can use any appliance to monitor anything that&#8217;s
valuable to your team.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!
